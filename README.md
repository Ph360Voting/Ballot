# A decentralized Voting dApp built using Truffle 

### Made by Shifra and Guy as part of our final project for Ph360

dApp will run on port 4200 and try to connect to the blockchain through port 7545.
If you wanna change this it can be done in the bs-config.json and truffle.js respectivly.

## To run the full dApp, download and run in the dApp folder:
```
npm install
truffle compile
truffle migrate
npm run dev
```

## To simply see the front-end, one can download and simply run in the dApp folder
```
npm run dev
```
